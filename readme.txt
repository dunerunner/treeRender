Tree Rendering Test Task

1) 2 solutions(iterative, recursive)

2) I have used Angular because I have the most experience with it and it is relatively easy to run tests with it. Also it provides a very easy solution to recursive tree rendering.

3) Native JavaScript.

4) Tests done with Karma + Jasmine for Unit, Protractor for E2E.

5) Code is modular, controllers, directives and services are in separate files.

6) I used loose coupling as much as possible and as much as Angular allows it.

7) Add/Edit/Delete buttons implemented with each node.

8) Subchildren added infinitely.

9,10) The information about trees is automatically stored in localstorage when nodes are added/edited/deleted.

11) I used some minimalistic design that I came up with. Nothing too comlex.
